
This workflow is designed to build the application from the ground up, starting with the backend data and logic, and then moving to the frontend to create the user interface. This approach ensures that the frontend has a working API to connect to at each stage of development.

### Development Workflow: Learning Style Assessment Engine

#### Phase 1: Backend Core (`LSA_backend`)

The goal of this phase is to create a functional backend that can serve assessment questions, process results, and provide preliminary recommendations.

1.  **Setup and Basic Server**
    *   **File:** `LSA_backend/package.json` - Define the project, dependencies (Express, CORS, body-parser), and scripts.
    *   **File:** `LSA_backend/src/app.js` - Set up the basic Express server, middleware, and a simple test route to confirm it's running.

2.  **Assessment Content and Logic**
    *   **Files:**
        *   `LSA_backend/src/components/vark/questions.js`
        *   `LSA_backend/src/components/programming-scenarios/questions.js`
        *   `LSA_backend/src/components/learning-preferences/questions.js`
        *   `LSA_backend/src/components/interactive-exercises/exercises.js`
        *   `LSA_backend/src/components/background/questions.js`
    *   **Task:** Populate these files with the actual questions for each section of the assessment.

3.  **Scoring and Recommendation Logic**
    *   **Files:**
        *   `LSA_backend/src/components/vark/scoring.js`
        *   `LSA_backend/src/components/programming-scenarios/scoring.js`
        *   `LSA_backend/src/components/learning-preferences/scoring.js`
        *   `LSA_backend/src/components/interactive-exercises/scoring.js`
        *   `LSA_backend/src/components/background/scoring.js`
    *   **Task:** Implement the scoring logic for each assessment component.
    *   **File:** `LSA_backend/src/utils/recommendationEngine.js`
    *   **Task:** Create the logic to calculate the overall weighted score and generate the preliminary learning style recommendations.

4.  **API Endpoints**
    *   **File:** `LSA_backend/src/api/assessmentRoutes.js` - Create the API endpoints to serve the questions for each assessment section.
    *   **File:** `LSA_backend/src/api/resultsRoutes.js` - Create the endpoint to receive the user's answers, use the scoring and recommendation engines, and return the final result.
    *   **File:** `LSA_backend/src/app.js` - Connect the new API routes to the Express app.

5.  **Service Layers (Initial)**
    *   **File:** `LSA_backend/src/services/assessmentService.js` - Implement the service that orchestrates the assessment flow (e.g., gets questions, processes answers).
    *   **File:** `LSA_backend/src/services/databaseService.js` - Create a mock/in-memory database service to store results temporarily.

#### Phase 2: Frontend Implementation (`LSA_frontend`)

With the backend API in place, you can now build the user interface.

1.  **Setup and Basic Structure**
    *   **File:** `LSA_frontend/package.json` - Define the project and dependencies (React, React-DOM, Axios/fetch).
    *   **File:** `LSA_frontend/public/index.html` - Basic HTML shell.
    *   **File:** `LSA_frontend/src/index.js` and `LSA_frontend/src/App.js` - Set up the main React application structure and routing (if needed).

2.  **API Service**
    *   **File:** `LSA_frontend/src/services/api.js` - Create functions to communicate with the backend API (e.g., `getVarkQuestions()`, `submitResults()`).

3.  **Assessment Components**
    *   **Files:**
        *   `LSA_frontend/src/components/assessment/VARKTest.js`
        *   `LSA_frontend/src/components/assessment/ProgrammingScenarioTest.js`
        *   ... and so on for each assessment component.
    *   **Task:** Build the React components to display the questions from the API and collect user answers.
    *   **File:** `LSA_frontend/src/components/common/Question.js` and `ProgressTracker.js` - Build these reusable components to maintain a consistent look and feel.

4.  **Application Flow**
    *   **File:** `LSA_frontend/src/App.js` - Implement the logic to guide the user through the different sections of the assessment in the correct order.

5.  **Results Display**
    *   **Files:**
        *   `LSA_frontend/src/components/results/ResultsPage.js`
        *   `LSA_frontend/src/components/results/ScoreBreakdown.js`
        *   `LSA_frontend/src/components/results/Recommendations.js`
    *   **Task:** Build the components to display the final results and preliminary recommendations returned from the backend.

***

#### Phase 3: Integration and Refinement

This phase focuses on connecting all the pieces, testing thoroughly, and preparing for future enhancements.

1.  **Database Integration**
    *   **File:** `LSA_backend/src/services/databaseService.js` - Replace the mock service with a real database connection (e.g., MongoDB with Mongoose, or a SQL database).
    *   **Task:** Update `resultsRoutes.js` to use the new database service.

2.  **ML Module Integration**
    *   **File:** `LSA_backend/src/api/mlProxyRoutes.js` - Implement the logic to forward the assessment data to the ML module's API endpoint.
    *   **Task:** This assumes the ML module will expose its own API.

3.  **Testing**
    *   **Files:** `LSA_backend/tests/*.js` - Write unit and integration tests for the backend logic and API endpoints.
    *   **Task:** Manually test the end-to-end flow from the frontend to ensure everything works as expected.

4.  **Documentation**
    *   **File:** `README.md` - Update the README with detailed instructions on how to set up, run, and use the complete application, including any new steps for database or ML integration.
